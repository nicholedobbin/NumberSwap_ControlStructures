# **Swap Numbers with Conditionals and Loops**

## **Description**
This program uses a for loop and nested 'if..else if..else' statement that prompts the user to enter a number of 3 digits or more. The program then swaps the second and last digit of the inputted number, and outputs both the inputted number and converted number to the console and as an alert.
